# DATA ANALYSIS
### Top-performing products and product classes by sales and quantity sold are as follows:
 - Analgesics led product sales with €2,435,013,957 and a quantity of 5,711,311 units.
 - Antiseptics followed closely with €2,288,542,859 in sales and 5,616,263 units.
 - Mood Stabilizers made €2,099,699,685 in sales and 5,291,908 units.
 - Antipyretics(€1,939,000,996 in sales and 4,170,233 units), Antibiotics(€1,801,883,1433 in sales and 4,272,213 units) and Antimalarials(€1,527,788,483 in sales and 4,331,651 units)also made significant contributions in terms of both sales and quantity.

 ### Sales performance by country, city, and customer segments (hospitals vs. pharmacies) are as follows:
* Sales by Country:
- Germany's Dominance: With 94% of total sales, Germany clearly dominated the pharmaceutical market. This indicates a robust and well-established market presence in Germany, where most of the sales and revenue are generated.
  Germany’s sustained lead suggests that the market has matured, with well-developed sales channels and a solid customer base. It may also reflect strong healthcare infrastructure, regulatory support, or higher demand for pharmaceutical products.

- Poland’s Growth in 2018: Poland experienced a significant spike in sales, reaching 19% of total sales, while Germany held 81%. This growth in Poland suggests that a successful campaign or external factors, such as regulatory changes or increased demand for healthcare services, may have driven the surge.
Despite this spike, Poland’s overall contribution across the analysis period was just 6%, indicating that while there was potential for growth in Poland, it was not sustained over the following years. This points to the need for a targeted strategy to fully capitalize on Poland’s market potential.

### Top Sales by City: 
Butzbach generated the highest sales overall, with €96,374,052 over the analysis period. This city consistently outperformed others, indicating it could be a crucial market for pharmaceutical products. The significant sales volume suggests a strong customer base, high demand for pharmaceutical products, or effective distribution channels.
 - 2017: Aurich (€22,867,841) - Aurich had the highest sales in 2017, standing out as a leading market for that year.
 - 2018: Ludwigshafen (€20,949,794) – Ludwigshafen took the lead in 2018, demonstrating strong regional demand for pharmaceutical products.
 - 2019: Sumanazol (€113,954,535) - Sumanazol had the highest sales of any city across the analysis period in 2019, which could have been driven by either a significant event, new product launches, or a surge in demand.
 - 2020: Baesweiler (€51,597,368) – Baesweiler showed strong sales performance in 2020, indicating a stable and growing market.
   
### Low Sales by city: 
Sczcytno recorded the lowest overall sales, with €1,697,972. This suggests either limited demand, market saturation, or ineffective marketing strategies in this city. Sczcytno's underperformance could indicate the need for further analysis or re-evaluation of the distribution and marketing efforts in that region.The cities with the least sales for each year:
  - 2017: Friedrichshafen (€1,431,962) – The lowest-performing city in 2017, potentially indicating weaker distribution or market penetration in this area.
  - 2018: Gaggenau (€1,325,403) – In 2018, Gaggenau had the lowest sales, which might suggest underutilized market potential or low awareness of pharmaceutical products.
  - 2019: Bergish Gladbach (€1,178,131) – Sales in Bergish Gladbach were the lowest in 2019, showing a possible issue in market engagement or access.
  - 2020: Lohne (€1,697,972) – Lohne posted the lowest sales in 2020, indicating limited growth or market challenges in that region.

### Sales by Channel:
- Pharmacies as the Leading Channel:
Pharmacies contributed 53% of total sales, outperforming hospitals, which contributed 47%. This suggests that pharmacies are the primary sales channel for pharmaceutical products, likely due to their accessibility, widespread presence, and the convenience they offer to consumers for purchasing medications.
The dominance of pharmacies could be attributed to their role in distributing over-the-counter (OTC) medications, prescription drugs, and personal health products, which are essential components of pharmaceutical sales.

- Hospitals' Contribution:
Hospitals accounted for 47% of sales, which is still a significant share, indicating that a large portion of pharmaceutical sales comes from treatments administered within hospital settings, particularly for more complex or specialized medications.
While pharmacies led in total sales, the relatively close percentage split between pharmacies and hospitals shows that both channels are crucial for the distribution of pharmaceutical products. Hospitals might primarily handle more specialized treatments, prescription-only medications, and critical care supplies, explaining their substantial share.

### The performance of sales representatives and teams over time
- Top Performers:
Jimmy Grey led the sales representatives with €1,003,916,602 in total sales. This impressive figure indicates that Jimmy consistently performed at a high level, likely playing a key role in driving revenue for the company. His success could be attributed to factors like strong client relationships, expertise in product knowledge, and effective sales strategies.
Abigail Thompson closely followed with €999,600,266 in sales, demonstrating that she is nearly as effective as Jimmy in driving results. The narrow margin between the two suggests that both are crucial assets to the sales team.
- Implication: The exceptional performance of Jimmy and Abigail highlights the importance of individual sales representatives in the overall success of the company. Their ability to close deals and generate high revenue shows that they are highly valuable, and their approaches could serve as a benchmark for training other sales reps.

- Delta Team: Delta Team achieved the highest sales across all teams, generating €3,721,881,779 in total sales. This team’s success suggests that they have a strong combination of top-performing individuals, effective teamwork, and efficient sales processes. Delta's performance could also indicate superior market coverage, customer engagement, or targeted sales strategies.
  
- Alfa Team: Alfa Team recorded the lowest sales at €2,662,909,343, which, while still a substantial amount, indicates room for improvement compared to Delta. The gap between Alfa and Delta suggests that Alfa may need to refine its sales strategies, improve internal coordination, or better align with customer needs to increase their performance.

# DASHBOARD

# MAP CHART USING POWERBI

# INSIGHTS
* The dominance of Germany in pharmaceutical sales indicates that it will likely continue to be the core market for the foreseeable future. Companies should maintain and enhance their market share by optimizing supply chains, expanding product portfolios, and continuing customer engagement efforts.

* The notable rise in Poland’s sales share in 2018 suggests untapped market potential. While this growth was not sustained, a renewed focus on Poland could result in further market expansion. This could involve targeted marketing, product localization, or partnership strategies to maintain and grow the customer base in Poland.

* Butzbach’s High Sales: Consistently high sales suggest a strong market presence and efficient sales strategies. This city should be a focus for continued engagement, as it has shown resilience and demand over time.

* Fluctuations in Top Performers: Each year sees a different city leading in sales, highlighting dynamic shifts in city-level demand. Cities like Sumanazol in 2019 and Aurich in 2017 performed exceptionally well, suggesting there may be external factors driving yearly spikes (e.g., specific product launches, regional campaigns, or events).

* Cities like Friedrichshafen, Gaggenau, Bergish Gladbach, and Lohne repeatedly rank among the lowest in yearly sales. These areas may require strategic reassessment, either to identify opportunities for growth or to streamline operations where profitability remains minimal.

* Pharmacies have proven to be the top-performing channel, with 53% of total sales. Businesses should prioritize optimizing their presence in pharmacies by building strong relationships with retail chains, ensuring a steady supply of in-demand products, and leveraging marketing campaigns targeted at pharmacy customers.

* Although pharmacies lead, hospitals still represent a critical sales channel, contributing 47%. Pharmaceutical companies should ensure that hospitals have access to specialized drugs, build relationships with healthcare providers, and possibly explore bulk supply agreements to increase sales in this channel.

* The combined sales of Jimmy Grey and Abigail Thompson amount to approximately €2 billion, underscoring their crucial role in the company’s overall success. These top performers are likely responsible for managing key accounts, closing large deals, or covering high-demand territories.

* The significant difference in sales between Delta Team (€3.72 billion) and Alfa Team (€2.66 billion) suggests that there are notable performance disparities across teams. Delta’s lead indicates that they may be more effective in their sales strategies or have more experienced or higher-performing individuals.

* Despite Alfa’s relatively lower sales, their contribution is still significant. However, the gap between them and Delta suggests that Alfa Team’s approach may need to be reassessed. Areas such as lead generation, customer engagement, or sales process optimization could be targeted to boost Alfa’s overall performance.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
* Reinvigorate the Polish Market: The brief but notable growth in 2018 suggests potential in Poland that should be further explored. Developing more localized strategies—such as product differentiation, increased promotion, or partnerships with local pharmacies and hospitals—could help rekindle growth in this market.

* Deepen Investment in High-Performing Cities: Cities like Butzbach and Sumanazol should be prioritized for further investment in sales strategies, marketing, and distribution to maximize returns.

* Address Underperforming Markets: Focus on understanding why cities like Sczcytno and Lohne underperformed. Consider revisiting pricing, product availability, marketing, and customer outreach strategies to determine whether these cities have untapped potential.

* Monitor Yearly Trends: Given that the top-performing cities vary year-to-year, it would be beneficial to monitor regional market conditions more closely and allocate resources dynamically based on emerging trends.

* Reassess Low Sales Regions: For cities that consistently show low sales, such as Bergish Gladbach and Gaggenau, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to determine if these markets are worth further investment or if operations should be scaled down.

* Enhance Pharmacy Partnerships: Given that pharmacies represent the largest sales channel, it would be beneficial to invest in deeper relationships with pharmacy chains and distributors. Offering targeted incentives, such as discounts for bulk purchases or exclusive product launches, could further strengthen this channel.

* Maximize Hospital Opportunities: Hospitals, with nearly half the sales, should not be overlooked. Offering specialized product training for hospital staff, ensuring timely delivery of critical medications, and establishing exclusive partnerships for medical products used in inpatient care could drive further growth.

* Leverage Top Sales Reps for Training and Mentorship: Jimmy Grey and Abigail Thompson should be considered for leadership or mentorship roles. Their successful sales techniques could be documented and used to train other sales reps. Additionally, they could lead workshops or one-on-one coaching sessions to elevate the performance of other team members.

* Analyze and Replicate Delta Team’s Success: Delta Team’s success should be thoroughly analyzed to identify what specific strategies or practices led to their outstanding performance. Whether it’s better customer targeting, team coordination, or superior sales techniques, these insights should be shared across the organization to boost the performance of other teams, especially Alfa.

* Focus on Performance Improvement for Alfa Team: Alfa Team should be supported with targeted initiatives aimed at improving their sales results. This could involve additional training, better access to resources or tools, or refining their sales processes. A closer analysis of their sales pipeline may also reveal bottlenecks or inefficiencies that can be addressed.

* Sales Recognition and Incentives: To maintain the momentum of high performers like Jimmy and Abigail and encourage the rest of the sales team, introducing a formal recognition program or performance-based incentives could help sustain high sales performance across the board. Celebrating top performers and teams publicly may also inspire healthy competition among the salesforce.
