 - Antiseptics followed closely with €2,288,542,859 in sales and 5,616,263 units.
 - Mood Stabilizers made €2,099,699,685 in sales and 5,291,908 units.

 ### Sales performance by country, city, and customer segments (hospitals vs. pharmacies) are as follows:
* Sales by Country:
- Germany's Dominance: With 94% of total sales, Germany clearly dominated the pharmaceutical market. This indicates a robust and well-established market presence in Germany, where most of the sales and revenue are generated.
  Germany’s sustained lead suggests that the market has matured, with well-developed sales channels and a solid customer base. It may also reflect strong healthcare infrastructure, regulatory support, or higher demand for pharmaceutical products.

- Poland’s Growth in 2018: Poland experienced a significant spike in sales, reaching 19% of total sales, while Germany held 81%. This growth in Poland suggests that a successful campaign or external factors, such as regulatory changes or increased demand for healthcare services, may have driven the surge.
Despite this spike, Poland’s overall contribution across the analysis period was just 6%, indicating that while there was potential for growth in Poland, it was not sustained over the following years. This points to the need for a targeted strategy to fully capitalize on Poland’s market potential.
  
* Sales by City: Butzbach generated the highest sales overall, with €96,374,052 over the analysis period. This city consistently outperformed others, indicating it could be a crucial market for pharmaceutical products. The significant sales volume suggests a strong customer base, high demand for pharmaceutical products, or effective distribution channels.
 - 2017: Aurich (€22,867,841) - Aurich had the highest sales in 2017, standing out as a leading market for that year.
 - 2018: Ludwigshafen (€20,949,794) – Ludwigshafen took the lead in 2018, demonstrating strong regional demand for pharmaceutical products.
 - 2019: Sumanazol (€113,954,535) - Sumanazol had the highest sales of any city across the analysis period in 2019, which could have been driven by either a significant event, new product launches, or a surge in demand.
 - 2020: Baesweiler (€51,597,368) – Baesweiler showed strong sales performance in 2020, indicating a stable and growing market.
   
*  Sales by city: Sczcytno recorded the lowest overall sales, with €1,697,972. This suggests either limited demand, market saturation, or ineffective marketing strategies in this city. Sczcytno's underperformance could indicate the need for further analysis or re-evaluation of the distribution and marketing efforts in that region.The cities with the least sales for each year:
  - 2017: Friedrichshafen (€1,431,962) – The lowest-performing city in 2017, potentially indicating weaker distribution or market penetration in this area.
  - 2018: Gaggenau (€1,325,403) – In 2018, Gaggenau had the lowest sales, which might suggest underutilized market potential or low awareness of pharmaceutical products.
  - 2019: Bergish Gladbach (€1,178,131) – Sales in Bergish Gladbach were the lowest in 2019, showing a possible issue in market engagement or access.
  - 2020: Lohne (€1,697,972) – Lohne posted the lowest sales in 2020, indicating limited growth or market challenges in that region.

 * Sales by Channel:
Pharmacy emerged as the top sales channel, contributing 53% of the total sales, while Hospitals accounted for the remaining 47%. Pharmacies appear to be the primary outlet for pharmaceutical sales, outpacing hospital sales across the years.
